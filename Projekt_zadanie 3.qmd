## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(odbc)
library(DBI)


con <- dbConnect(odbc(),
                 driver = "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server",
                 server = "mssql-2017.labs.wmi.amu.edu.pl",
                 database = "iliagil",
                 uid = "bigdata_s1200519"
                 )
```

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
